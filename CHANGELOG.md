*   Support Signed and Encrypted Cookie Storage (#27)

    With the `:signed` option passed into the Redis session store, you can
    now ensure that sessions will be set up in the browser using a
    signed/encrypted cookie. This prevents user tampering by changing their
    session ID or the data within the cookie.

    Closes #21

    getting problems on the Rails 4.0 and 4.1 Gemfiles.
